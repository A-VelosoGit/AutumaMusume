## Description

This Java project seeks to reduce the grind of farming sparks in Uma Musume on Steam by making careers semi-automatic. This is a personal challenge to train my skills. It is currently still in development, but my current goals are to:

1. General Screen Recognition Class: Create a class that recognizes the current screen, its goal button, and automatically moves the mouse towards the goal button (e.g. if in Home Screen, find Career button, change mouse position, then click)
2. GUI Class: Implement a GUI that allows the user to choose the Uma they want to grind sparks for, the legacies they want to use for her, the support card/formation you want to use, and what to prioritize during training/racing.
3. Auto-Training Class: Every new day, go through each stat and count the number of support cards with blue, green, or rainbow friendship. Different years have different formulas to prioritize different trainings. Also check if the odds for failure are blue, orange, or red.
4. Fan Goal Class: Check the Career screen if the current goal is to have X fans. Start racing.
5. Training Event Class: Auto-click on any buttons that show up.
6. Inspiration: Auto-click "Go".

This will be in active development until mid-October, after which I will work on this on and off.
